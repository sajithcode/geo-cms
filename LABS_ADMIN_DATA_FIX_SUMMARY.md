# 🔬 Labs Management Admin - Data Fetching Fix

## Issue Resolved ✅

The Labs Management Admin dashboard was not fetching data due to **database schema mismatches**. The issue has been completely resolved.

---

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Problems Identified:

1. **Column Name Mismatch**:

   - Code was using `user_id` but actual table uses `reported_by`
   - Code was using `computer_number` but actual table uses `computer_serial_no`
   - Code was using `created_at` but actual table uses `reported_date`

2. **Status Enum Mismatch**:

   - Code was looking for `'fixed'` status but actual enum uses `'resolved'`

3. **Schema Conflict**:
   - Multiple schema files (`database.sql`, `labs_system_setup.sql`, `issues_schema.sql`) had different structures
   - The actual database was using the `issues_schema.sql` structure

---

## 🛠️ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Fixed Admin Dashboard Queries** (`labs/admin-dashboard.php`)

**Issue Reports Statistics Query:**

```sql
-- BEFORE (incorrect)
SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'fixed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as fixed_issues

-- AFTER (correct)
SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'resolved' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as fixed_issues
```

**Issue Reports Data Query:**

```sql
-- BEFORE (incorrect)
JOIN users u ON ir.user_id = u.id
ORDER BY ir.created_at DESC

-- AFTER (correct)
JOIN users u ON ir.reported_by = u.id
ORDER BY ir.reported_date DESC
```

**Computer Display:**

```php
// BEFORE (incorrect)
<?php echo htmlspecialchars($issue['computer_number'] ?? 'N/A'); ?>

// AFTER (correct)
<?php echo htmlspecialchars($issue['computer_serial_no'] ?? 'N/A'); ?>
```

### 2. **Fixed Labs API** (`labs/php/labs_api.php`)

**Report Issue Action:**

```sql
-- BEFORE (incorrect)
INSERT INTO issue_reports (user_id, lab_id, computer_number, description, status)

-- AFTER (correct)
INSERT INTO issue_reports (reported_by, lab_id, computer_serial_no, description, status)
```

**Status Updates:**

```php
// BEFORE (incorrect)
if (!in_array($status, ['pending', 'in_progress', 'fixed'])) {
$resolved_at = $status === 'fixed' ? date('Y-m-d H:i:s') : null;

// AFTER (correct)
if (!in_array($status, ['pending', 'in_progress', 'resolved'])) {
$resolved_at = $status === 'resolved' ? date('Y-m-d H:i:s') : null;
```

**Issue Details Query:**

```sql
-- BEFORE (incorrect)
JOIN users u ON ir.user_id = u.id

-- AFTER (correct)
JOIN users u ON ir.reported_by = u.id
```

### 3. **Fixed Badge Function**

```php
// BEFORE (incorrect)
case 'fixed': return 'success';

// AFTER (correct)
case 'resolved': return 'success';
```
