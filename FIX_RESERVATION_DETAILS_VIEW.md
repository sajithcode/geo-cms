# Fix: Reservation Details View Error - Student Dashboard

## Issue Description

When students clicked the "View" button in their "My Reservation Requests" table, they received an error:

```
An error occurred while loading reservation details ×
```

## Root Cause

The `displayReservationDetails()` function in `labs.js` was trying to access database fields that don't exist:

- `reservation.lab_code` - This field doesn't exist in the database
- `reservation.expected_attendees` - This field doesn't exist in the database

## Solution

### 1. Updated `displayReservationDetails()` Function (js/labs.js)

**Changed from:**

```javascript
<strong>Lab:</strong> ${reservation.lab_name} (${reservation.lab_code})
<strong>Expected Attendees:</strong> ${reservation.expected_attendees}
```

**Changed to:**

```javascript
<strong>Reservation ID:</strong> #${reservation.id || 'N/A'}
<strong>Lab:</strong> ${reservation.lab_name || 'N/A'}
<strong>Lab Capacity:</strong> ${reservation.capacity} seats (conditionally shown)
```

### 2. Improvements Made

#### Safer Field Access

- Added null checks for all fields using `|| 'N/A'`
- Only shows fields that actually exist in the database
- Uses conditional rendering for optional fields

#### Better Data Display

- Shows reservation ID at the top
- Displays lab capacity from the database
- Shows approved date if available
- Highlights rejection reason in red
- Properly formats all dates and times

#### Fields Now Shown

1. ✅ Reservation ID
2. ✅ Lab name
3. ✅ Reservation date
4. ✅ Time slot (start - end)
5. ✅ Purpose
6. ✅ Lab capacity
7. ✅ Status (with colored badge)
8. ✅ Requested date/time
9. ✅ Approved by (if approved)
10. ✅ Approved date (if approved)
11. ✅ Rejection reason (if rejected)
12. ✅ Admin/staff notes (if any)

### 3. Added CSS Styling (css/labs.css)

Added professional styling for the reservation details modal:

```css
.reservation-details {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: 12px;
}

.detail-row {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  padding: 10px;
  background: #f8f9fa;
  border-radius: 6px;
  border-left: 3px solid #007bff;
}
```

**Features:**

- Clean card-based layout for each detail
- Blue left border for visual appeal
- Light background for readability
- Proper spacing between rows
- Responsive flex layout
- Color-coded rejection reasons

### 4. Bonus: Upcoming Reservations Styling

Also added styling for the upcoming reservations cards:

```css
.upcoming-reservation-card {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 15px;
  padding: 15px;
  background: #f8f9fa;
  border-radius: 8px;
  border-left: 4px solid #28a745;
}
```

## Database Fields Reference

The actual fields returned by `get_reservation_details` API:

```php
SELECT lr.*, l.name as lab_name, l.capacity,
       u.name as requester_name, u.user_id as requester_id, u.role as requester_role,
       approver.name as approved_by_name
FROM lab_reservations lr
```

**Available fields:**

- `id` - Reservation ID

- `lab_name` - Lab name (from join)
- `capacity` - Lab capacity (from join)
- `user_id` - Requester user ID

- `reservation_date` - Date of reservation
- `start_time` - Start time
- `end_time` - End time
